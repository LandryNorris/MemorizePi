Memorize Pi
===========

This app is designed to facilitate memorizing the digits of Pi.

Technology
----------

This app uses Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile to allow code to be
cross-platform, while also running close to native. The UI is
created using Jetbrains Compose.

Status of iOS code
------------------

Jetbrains is working on iOS support in their fork of Compose.
Because I use Compose for Android UI in this project, I plan to
wait until iOS support for Compose reaches public release. Until
then, the app will remain Android-only in terms of UI. Logic will
be written cross-platform, however.
